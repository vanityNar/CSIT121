            <h2>How to Use Payment Method Identifier (PMI)</h2>
            <p>
                Payment Method Identifiers(PMIs) are mainly used in web-based payment systems.
                When you shop online, websites list differnet ways to pay, and each option has a 
                unique identifier.This helps the website know which paymnet method to use 
                when you check out, making the payment process quicker and safer.
            </p>
            <p>
                A PMI's job is to clearly identify which payment method is being used, so the transaction goes 
                to the right place for processing.These identifier can be in differnetforms, like a simple text string or a 
                URL, depending on the system. This flexibility allows many payment
                methods, such as credit cards or digital wallets, to work smoothly on a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you choose to pay with Apple Pay, the website 
                will use a PMI like "https//apple.com/pay". when you select Apple pay
                , this identifirer is sent to the merchant's system, which knows to Use
                Apple pay's payment process to complet the transaction securely.
