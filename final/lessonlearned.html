            <h1>Lesson Learned</h1>
            <p> Throughout this semester, I’ve had the opportunity to learn a great deal about web design. 
                From mastering the basics of HTML to exploring the power of CSS for styling and diving into the interactivity of JavaScript,
                 I’ve gained valuable skills.</p>

               <p> While I’ve made significant progress, I know there is still much to learn and plenty of practice ahead, particularly with JavaScript.
                 Most of the web pages I’ve created so far have been simple, which didn’t require extensive use of JavaScript. However, in the future,
                  when I have the ability to build more dynamic and professional websites, I look forward to applying JavaScript to enhance functionality and user experience.
