            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Nar Thapa, and I am a student at CCBC.
                I am currently pursuing my major in Information Technology (IT) and am eager to begin my career in the field of computer science.
                 Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong passion for web development and programming, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in these areas.</p>
                                 
               <p> This website serves as a reflection of my progress and skills throughout this course. From mastering the fundamentals of HTML to exploring the styling power of CSS, 
                I have applied all the essential tools and techniques I've learned to create this site. It not only showcases my technical abilities but also represents my dedication
                 to personal and professional growth in the world of web development.</p>
                
               <p> As I continue to expand my knowledge and expertise, I aim to create more advanced, dynamic websites and applications that make a meaningful impact. 
                I look forward to the opportunities ahead and am excited to share my work with you through this portfolio! </p>
