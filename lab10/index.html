            <h2>Introduction to Payment Method Identifier (PMI)</h2>
                <p> 
                 A payment Method identifier (PMIs) is a special code that helps identify a  payment method,
                like a credit card or digital wallet,with outshowing any sensitive details.instead of using your actual card number
                or wallet info, the PMI lets the paymnet system process transactions securely. This way personal
                information stays private while still allowng you to pay for things easily.
                </p>
            <p>
                PMIs are helpful when you use more than one payment method. For example, you might
                use a credit card for in-store purchases and a digital wallet for onine shopping. The PMI links these
                different payment methods to your account, so you can choose which one to use without revealing
                your payment details. This makes payment simple and secure.
            </p>
            <P>
                The main reason PMIs are important is security, by not sharing your real paymnet details,the 
                chances of fraud or identity theft are lower.
