            <h2>Lab 02 Reflection</h2>
            <p>This is my reflection on lab 02..I have some basic knowledge about
                 HTML and its atructure, but I don't have any idea about validate and publish.
                through this module i learned to validate and publishing, 
                and learned about the web standareds.
             just learning HTML code is easy, but when it comes to put the things in structure and publish public, its seems little nerves and become complicated, <br>
             but with the all the help of this module, I am feeling  more confident. Hope every further steps will be the same.

            <h2>Lab 03 Reflection</h2>
            <p>This is my reflection on lab 03...I really loving the CSS practice ,
                at first it looked like litte confusion on the types of styles like id and class,embedded , internal and external.<br>
               ater a little practice now its clear and entertaining to me. Now i can change the color of background,and text, font style their size.
               Their align etc.<br></p>

            <h2>Lab 05 Reflection</h2>
            <p>This is my reflection on lab 05, where I worked on implementing a responsive
                 design using CSS grid or flexbox i enjoyed while reading it. but when i started 
                it really confusing me and put me in dellima. I literally didn't have any idea whereto 
            start and how to design I watched so many videos on youtube but my situation is 
        different than they teach me. I really panic a lot, i tried first to edit the lab03 content
    it teach me one thing is that strat from scratch is better than editing previous work.
so i decide to start from the scratch and able to make like this.<p>
    I know that this not good one but i promise i will make it better next time more attaractive 
    and more user friendly and more compatible. I am still confuse in media queiry.cannot able to 
    handel properly.
