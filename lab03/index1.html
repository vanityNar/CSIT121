    <h1>Learning Web Standared</h1><hr>
        <h2>Things I learned during this module</h2>
                 <p>I have some basic knowledge about HTML and its atructure, but I don't have any idea about validate and publish.<br>
                    through this module i learned to validate and publishing, and learned about the web standareds.<br>
                 just learning HTML code is easy, but when it comes to put the things in structure and publish public, its seems little nerves and become complicated, <br>
                 but with the all the help of this module, I am feeling  more confident. Hope every further steps will be the same.
                <br></p>
